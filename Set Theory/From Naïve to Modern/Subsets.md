##### Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. $B$ is a **subset** of $A$, denoted by $B \subseteq A$, if and only if
$$
\forall x(x \in B \implies x \in A).
$$
$B$ is a **proper subset** of $A$, denoted by $B \subsetneq A$, if and only if
$$
B \subseteq A \land \exists x(x \in A \land x \notin B).
