# How "Many" Elements Are There?


My dear friend,

Thank you for being with me until here. I arrange the last several letters as the "Chapter 1" of our conversation. In this chapter, we talked about ...

Now, I think we should end this chapter with this letter talking about a concept that is imperfect within our context so far, **sizes of a sets**, such that we would realized one of the motivation of the next chapter â€“ why it is essential for analysis if we axiomatize it through ZFC but not other axiomatizations of set theory.

For revealing this motivation, let temporarily accept some concepts which is definable in ZFC but undefined during our conversation yet. We have been familiar with them.

1. $\mathbb N$, the set of all natural numbers.
2. $\mathbb Z$, the set of all integers.
3. $\mathbb Q$, the set of all rational numbers.
5. $\mathbb R$, the set of all real numbers.
6. The decimal system of real numbers. for example, $\pi = 3.1415\ldots\;$, $\frac{1}{3} = 0.33\dot 3$, where $\dot 3$ means $3$ repeatedly appears in the succeeding positions.

Since I am not good at calculating, the last one won't be used to explain the axiomatization of the theory. It is only invoked when intuitively interpreting.
